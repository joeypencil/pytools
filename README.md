# pytools
My repository of python scripts for various purposes. Each script will be contained in its own folder. Custom packages will be placed in the `packages` directory, which will contain all the modules I will be using.

### Registry handler

This script can be used to perform CRUD operations on the Windows registry values. Once it is executed, it has its own cmd-like interface, where the command `help` will display all available commands.
